          Your contract will use these ERC-20 tokens like tickets, handing them
          out to people as a receipt for payments received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ticket holders can claim a portion of your project's overflow, and can
          vote on proposed changes to your budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Issuing tickets will deploy your ERC-20 contract, which will cost gas.
          If you don't feel like doing this now, you can do it anytime
          laterâ€”your project will automatically use IOU tickets in the meantime,
          so you won't lose any functionality.
