## JB app release + contributions process

All changes to the `main` branch will be automatically via [Fleek](https://fleek.co). Contributions to `main` should be created as a pull request, and a live Fleek preview will be automatically deployed. Before merged, each PR must:

- Verify that all CI checks pass before merging
- For significant UX changes, be discussed by other design/dev contributors
- Be approved by at least one code owner
